# BlogStorage-CollectionsEx2-
Small exercise for class in which we're asked to make a 'blog' storage thing. Also, an experiment with getting VS hooked up to GitHub

Type in your name and a small blog post (think less a blog post, more a tweet) and have it sent into the app's inbuilt database.

Then, use the search features to bring up your blog post or a friend's!
